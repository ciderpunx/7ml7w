-- Find the music for your favourite adventure movie's theme song
-- and translate it to Lua. Play it with the music player you wrote.

-- cf: imperial-death-march.lua

-- The way it stands, we have to put require 'notation' at the beginning of every 
-- song and song.go() at the end. Modify play.cpp to do this for you so that songs 
-- can just containn the tempo and parts.

-- cf: notation.lua, just added calls to luaL_dostring
