Installing on Debian Jessie: 
$ sudo aptitude install lua5.2

* don't like 1 indexing of arrays
* tables are quite nice as a data structure
* the REPL would be better with completion rlwrap doesn't add it but made history work better
  $ sudo aptitude instal rlwrap
* Don't like the fact that you have to define functions before you can use them (in the file)
* The metatable stuff was hard until I had an insight that the global environment was a table and threfore creating a new table was just adding an element to a table. So I could the use __newindex metatable event to override default behaviour. cf: http://lua-users.org/wiki/MetatableEvents which also gave me a clue about rawset.
* Don't like the self.xxx notation all that much; it makes my code a bit more cluttered than I'd like.
